                    <p>Song of Ineffable begins with a sustained inquiry into the threshold where language loosens and experience exceeds articulation. Human beings rely on language to communicate, yet language often fails to hold the depth and nuance of lived feeling. Words stabilize meaning, but emotions remain fluid, unstable, and difficult to translate. This gap between expression and perception became the conceptual foundation of the work.</p>

                    <p>My research draws from philosophical reflections on music and the ineffable. Vladimir Jankélévitch writes of music as that which resists complete explanation, existing at the edge of language where meaning dissolves into sensation. Friedrich Nietzsche describes music as both universal and primary—a force that precedes rational thought and reconnects the human body to instinct and nature. Rather than approaching music as representation, these ideas guided me toward understanding sound as an experiential field, one that allows feeling to emerge before it becomes concept.</p>

                    <p>Susanne Langer’s theory of music as a symbolic form also informed the project, particularly her proposal that music articulates patterns of feeling rather than fixed meaning. In parallel, Roland Barthes’ notion of the “grain of the voice” offered a way to think about sound beyond linguistic clarity: the voice as texture, presence, and bodily trace. Together, these references shaped my understanding of music not as a language to be decoded but as a space where emotional resonance circulates between bodies.</p>

                    <p>Water became a central material within this investigation. Its instability and fluidity mirror the way emotions shift before they become words. Unlike rigid structures that impose boundaries, water allows forms to melt into one another, suggesting a mode of communication grounded in permeability and transformation. Within the installation, sound travels through water as both acoustic medium and metaphor, creating an environment in which listening becomes a process of gradual dissolving—of distance, of separation, and of fixed identity.</p>

                    <p>Alongside philosophical inquiry, the work engages with physiological research into emotion. Drawing from models of valence and arousal, as well as facial electromyography (fEMG), I explored how subtle muscular responses might influence musical structure. These signals are not presented as data but translated into harmony, tempo, and texture, allowing the body’s micro-expressions to shape the sonic environment indirectly. In this way, emotional states are not represented but embodied within sound.</p>

                    <p>At the conceptual core of the project lies the notion of philia, understood as a form of connection between equal spirits. By recording my own facial electromyography while experiencing moments of philia, I translated these traces into compositions that resonate through water. The installation becomes a shared sonic field in which participants encounter one another beyond linguistic definition. Suspended structures, resonant surfaces, and water-filled vessels invite slow movement and attentive listening, allowing visitors to experience a subtle melting of boundaries between self and other.</p>

                    <p>Technology operates quietly beneath the surface—sensors, vibration systems, and fabricated structures shaping an environment where sound is felt as much as heard. Rather than foregrounding interface, the work constructs a condition in which perception unfolds gradually. Music here functions not as explanation but as presence, allowing individuals to sense the possibility of genuine understanding and connection as human beings.</p>

                    <p>In Song of Ineffable, the ineffable is not treated as absence but as a space of encounter. Influenced by philosophical thought yet grounded in embodied experience, the work proposes that when language loosens, another form of communication may emerge—one rooted in resonance, proximity, and shared temporality. Within this space, feeling does not seek resolution; it dissolves, reforms, and circulates between bodies, inviting participants to inhabit a moment where understanding arises through being together rather than through words.</p>
